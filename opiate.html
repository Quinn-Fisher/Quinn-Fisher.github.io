        <h2>Modelling Opioid Epidemic</h2>

        <p>
            During my undergraduate degree, I worked on a research project supervised by Professor Adam Stinchcombe in which 
            we attempted to model the rise in opiate addictions during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring of 2020. 
            The project was building on the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03658.pdf" target="_blank">Battista et al.</a> 
            where a compartment model for opiate addiction is presented. Essentially, we are using a system of differential equations to describe 
            the movement of people between various compartments. 
        </p>

        <h3>The Model</h3>
        <p>
            Below is a diagram of the compartment model we used. The copmartments are defined as follows
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> <b>S</b> - The susceptible population who are neither using opioids nor recovering from opioid dependence. </li>
            <li> <b>P</b> - The proportion of individuals who are using prescription opioids, but who have not developed an addiction.</li>
            <li> <b>A</b> - The proportion of the population exhibiting opioid dependence or opioid use disorder (prescription and/or illicit).</li>
            <li> <b>R</b> - The proportion of the population that is currently being treated for their opioid addiction.</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img class="right-floated-image" src="opiate_compartment_model.png" style="width: 80%;">
        </div>

        The table below outlines each of the parameters in the compartment model. We can then model the problem in python using ODE solvers.
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Parameter</th>

                <td> Illicit addiction rate based on interactions with P</td>

            <tr>
                <td>\( \delta \)</td>
                <td> Successful treatment rate for R </td>

                <td> Death rate (S, P, R) </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>\( \mu^* \)</td>
                <td> Death rate of addicted (A) </td>
            </tr>

          </table>

          <h3>Time Dependent Parameters</h3>

          <p>
            The work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03658.pdf" target="_blank">Battista et al.</a> 
            operates under the assumption that all parameters remain constant. Inspired by the increase in adduction 
            rates of spring 2020, we introduce time dependent parameters for the model. Specifically, we are focused on 
            the time dependence of the addiction parameters \(\gamma,\, \beta_P\), and \(\beta_A\), as well as the prescription 
            rate \(\alpha\). The reason for focusing on these parameters specifically is due to the prescription rate generally being in 
            the control of healthcare system, and the fact that addiction rates have clearly changed with time.
          </p>


          <h3> Addiction "Outbreaks"</h3>

          <p>
            For the remainder of this writup, I'll be quite brief in my explanations. This project had to stop 
            unexpectedly due to some health issues of a team member. By the time those issues were resolved, most of the team members (myself included) 
            were off doing other things. If you've read this far, chances are you're somewhat interested 
            in the project. If thats the case, and you're finding that my explanations aren't sufficient or you want to know more, you 
            should definitely reach out to me! I'd love to discuss.
          </p>

          <p>
            After implementing the changes to the model, we aimed to simulate the rapid rise in addiction that was seen at the beginning of the 
            COVID-19 pandemic. In reality, the rise in addiction rates has been present since long before COVID-19. As an initial proof of concept, 
            we first implemented a rise in all addiction parameters. That is, all parameter rates going into the addicted compartment. Mathematically, 
            this is described by a new parameter \( \kappa \). For a given addiction rate \(\beta\) with an "outbreak" start time of \(t_\text{start}\) 
            and end time of \(t_\text{end}\), the rate at a given time, \(a(t) \), can be written as
          </p>

        <div>
            \[
            a(t)= \begin{cases}\beta & 0 \leq t \leq t_{\text{start}} \\ \beta+\frac{\beta(\kappa-1)\left(t-t_{\text{start }}\right)}{l_{\text{increase }}} & t_{\text{start}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{start}}+l_{\text{increase}} \\ \kappa \beta & t_{\text{start }}+l_{\text{increase}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{end }}-l_{\text{decrease }} \\ \kappa \beta+\frac{\beta(1-\kappa)\left(t-t_{\text{end}}+l_{\text{decrease}}\right)}{l_{\text{decrease}}} & t_{\text{end}}-l_{\text{decrease}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{end}} \\ \beta & t_{\text{end}} \leq t\end{cases}
            \]
        </div>

        <p>
            Essentially, there is a baseline addition rate \(\beta\) which then linearly increases until it reaches \(\kappa \beta\). After the outbreak ends, it linearly 
            decreases to the original rate. When implementing these addiction "outbreaks", define the parameters \(\gamma,\, \beta_P \), and \(\beta_A\) in the above manner.
        </p>


        <h3>Prescription "Lockdowns"</h3>

        <p>
            To manage the addiction outbreaks above, we tried to think of what a public health unit could immedietly do. As an initial experiment, we 
            decided to see how a prescription "lockdown" would affect such a scenario. That is, the lowering of the optiate prescription rate in response 
            to a rapid rise in opiate addiction. <b>Its important to note that this experiment a closed system that is strictly looking at numbers in a simulation. The social 
            effects of any of our experiments would have to be deeply considered before anything was put into actual use and its likely that there would be a large number 
            of consequences that this model cannot encapsulate. The opiate epidemic has changed a lot since its beginnings and the humanity of those involved must always be considered </b>. With that being said, we introduce a new parameter, \(\lambda\), which dictates the severity of the prescription lockdown. 
            For a given prescription rate, \(\alpha\), lockdown start time of \(t_\text{start}\) and end time of \(t_\text{end}\), the rate at a given time, \(p(t) \), can be written as
        </p>

        <div>
            \[
            p(t)= \begin{cases}\alpha & 0 \leq t &lt; t_{\text {start }} \\ \lambda \alpha & t_{\text {start }} \leq t \leq t_{\text {end }} \\ \alpha & t_{\text {end }}&lt;t\end{cases}
            \]
        </div>

        <p> In other words, the prescription rate goes from \(\alpha\) to \(\lambda \alpha\) during a lockdown.</p>


    <h3>Simulations</h3>
    
        <p>
            To give you an idea of how the system behaves, here we present some simulations. Below are two scenarios. 
            <b>Left:</b> Proportion of population addicted during addiction outbreaks of various levels from \(t = 1 \) to \(t = 2\).
             <b>Right: </b> Proportion of population addicted during prescription lockdowns of various levels from \(t = 1 \) to \(t = 2\).
        </p>

            <img class="right-floated-image" src="opiate_prescription_lockdown.png" style="width: 50%;">
        </div>

        <p>
            We can also bring together both scenarios above to yield addiction outbreaks with \(\kappa = 3\) from time \(t = 1\) to \(t = 2\), with various 
            prescription lockdown levels. That result is plotted below. In an effort to be somewhat realistic, we start the lockdown 2 months after the outbreak. 
            Note that the scenario of a full lockdown ( \( \lambda = 0\)) achieves almost the same result post-outbreak as no outbreak at all.
        </p>

        </div>

    
    <h3> Evaluating the Results</h3>

        <p>
            In order to get meaningful information about the cumulative amount of addiction occurring over a period of time, we need to work with a unit 
            that better suits the scenario. Since \(A(t)\) is the proportion of the population addicted to opiates at time $t$, if we set up an additional 
            compartment for cumulative addiction which we will call \(AC(t)\), we can write its derivative as
            $$\frac{d AC(t)}{dt} = A, \qquad AC(t_0) = 0 $$
            where \(t_0\) is the initial desired time value (in our case, \(t_0 = 0\)). Then, since all of our parameters/units are annual, solving for 
            \(AC(t)\) will give us the total number of ``Addiction Years" per person gained over the given time interval \([t_0, t]\). We opt to use the 
            per person value as to not make any assumptions about population size - this could easily be changed by multiplying values by population size. 
            The fact that \(AC(0) = 0\) is what makes this value the net value of addiction years gained - a value that will be useful for analyzing outbreak 
            response effectiveness. Note that 1 Addiction Year is the equivalent of 1 full year of time addicted distributed among a given population, i.e. 
            1 person addicted for 1 year, 2 people addicted for 0.5 years, 1 person addicted for 0.5 years plus 2 people addicted for 0.25 years, and so on. 
            This unit's focus is on how much addiction there is, not necessarily how it is distributed.
        </p>

        <p> 
            The picture below is the same scenario as the previous plot, but instead we plot addiction years per person. Though the improvement looks quite smalle, 
            it is important to remember that relvative to the units, it is quite an improbement. For example, in a population of 1 million, an improvement in 0.003 
            addiction years per person is a cumulative savings of 3000 addiction years.

        </p>

        </div>

    <h3> Optimizing Lockdowns </h3>

        <p>
            To get a sence for the optimal lockdown scenario, we can create a 2D plot of the amount of addiction years saved 
            for various lockdown start times and lockdown lengths. The project considered many scenarios, one of which is plotted below for an outbreak starting at \(t=0\). 
            The colour indicates the number of addiction years per person gained by the "outbreak", thus lower is better. The white, red, and 
            magenta lines represent 75%, 50%, and 25% of the optimal "lockdown". Perhaps unsurprisingly, the optimal lockdown is enacted as soon as possible 
            and is as strict as possible. This result remained constant throughout all of the simulations.


        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img class="right-floated-image" src="opiate_optimal_lockdown.png" style="width: 70%;">
        </div>

        <p>
            Below are a couple of plots showing the effects of the optimal lockdown as a response to various oubreak scenarios. The longer and larger 
            the outbreak, the more addiction years are saved by the optimal lockdown. These results, at face value, are sort of a sanity check, but the system itself 
            is still quite interesting.
        </p>

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

            <img class="right-floated-image" src="opiate_saved_addiction_years_per_person.jpeg" style="width: 50%;">
        </div>

    <h3>Fitting the Model to Data</h3>
        <p> 
            The next step in the project was to fit it to publically available health data. UNfortunately this portion of the project coincides with 
            the afformentioned health issues that halted the project. We were able to find some useful data from the Ontario government, though in general 
            the accecible data was quite poor. The main goal of this section was to use simmulated annealing to fit the model to data to assess what kind of "outbreak" 
            happened in spring of 2020, and then use the simulated lockdown to see how that could have potentially mitigated the rise in addiction and death. Again, stressing that 
            opiate addiction and public healthcare are extremely complicated and this simple idea of a prescription lockdown is certainly not sufficient and potentially not justified in a real 
            world scenario.
